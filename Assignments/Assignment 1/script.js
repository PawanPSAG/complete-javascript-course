Data Types
Declare a variable called isIsland and set its value according to your country.

let, const and var
Set the value of language to the language spoken where you live

Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never

Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens.

Basic Operatorsï»¿
If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,

Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than 
Finland?

The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does you country have

Taking Decisions: if / else Statements
If your country's population is greater than 33 million, log a string like this to 
the console: "Portugal's population is 22 million below average" (the 22 is the 
    average of 33 minus the country's population).

After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 130. 
See the different results, and set the population back to original.
