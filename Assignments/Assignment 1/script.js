Basic Operatorsï»¿

Finland?

The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does you country have 
less people than the average country?

Based on the variables you created, create a new variable description which contains

portuguese'.

Type Conversion and Coercion
*/

/*
1. Predict the result of these 5 operations without executing them:
console.log('9' - '5'); // -> ?
console.log('19' - '13' + '17'); // -> ?
console.log('19' - '13' + 17); // -> ?
console.log('123' < 57); // -> ?
console.log(5 + 6 + '4' + 9 - 4 - 2); // -> ?

/*
Equality Operators: == vs. ===
*/

/*
1. Declare a variable numNeighbours based on a prompt input like this:
  prompt('How many neighbour countries does your contry have?');
2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality == for now).
3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case numNeighbours is greater than 1.
4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when numNeighbours is 0 or any other value).
5. Test the code with different values of numNeighbours, including 1 and 0.
6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of numNeighbours. Notice what happens when 
there is exactly 1 border! Why is this happening?
7. Finally, convert numNeighbours to a number, and watch what happens now when you input 1.
8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this situation.

Logical Operators

1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way.
2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a country that 
speaks English, has less than 50 million people and is not an island.
3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her. You will need to write a 
condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
4. If yours is the right country, log a strings like this 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If not, log 
'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('.
5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily change some variables 
in order to make the condition true (unless you live in Canada :D).
